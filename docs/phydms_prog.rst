=======================================
the ``phydms`` program
=======================================

.. contents::

Overview
------------
``phydms`` can perform phylogenetic analyses with :ref:`ExpCM` as well as with some standard non-site-specific substitution models (variants of the *YNGKP* models described in `Yang, Nielsen, Goldman, and Krabbe Pederson, Genetics, 155:431-449`_). In addition, ``phydms`` can be used to detect site-specific diversifying or differential selection using the :ref:`ExpCM`.

See below for information on the `Command-line usage`_ and `Output files`_.

Command-line usage
--------------------
.. argparse::
   :module: parsearguments
   :func: PhyDMSParser
   :prog: phydms

   alignment
    Should contain aligned DNA codon sequences. 
    Stop codons are **not** allowed, except if a stop codon is the terminal character in all sequences, in which case they are automatically trimmed.

    No checking is done to remove identical sequences, so you may want to remove such sequences yourself if there a lot of them.

    The headers must be unique strings that do **not** contain any of the following: spaces, commas, colons, semicolons, parentheses, square brackets, and single or double quotes.

   tree
    Typically you infer this tree using a program such as `RAxML`_ or `codonPhyML`_.
    The topology is fixed to that in ``tree``. How the branch lengths are handled
    during optimization depends on ``--brlen``.
    The branch lengths in ``tree`` are assumed to be in codon substitutions
    per site.

   model
    *YNGKP_<m>* is a *non-site-specific* Goldman-Yang style codon model from `Yang, Nielsen, Goldman, and Krabbe Pederson, Genetics, 155:431-449`_. 
    The *<m>* indicates the model variant. 
    Codon frequencies are set empirically using the *CF3X4* method described by `Pond et al, PLoS One, 5:e11230`_ (this sets the codon frequencies to the the product of nucleotide frequency parameters at each of the three positions after correcting for stop codons).
    The transition-transversion ratio :math:`\kappa` is optimized by maximum likelihood. 
    The nonsynonymous-synonymous ratio :math:`\omega` is optimized differently depending on the variant:
     
        - *YNGKP_M0* : a single :math:`\omega` is optimized by maximum likelihood.

        - *YNGKP_M5* : :math:`\omega` drawn from a gamma distribution with the two parameters optimized by maximum likelihood. The distribution has ``--ncats`` categories.
 
    *ExpCM_<prefsfile>* is an :ref:`ExpCM` with amino-acid preferences taken from the file ``prefsfile``. 
    The preferences file must specify a preference for the amino acid encoded by every site in ``alignment``, using sequential 1, 2, ... numbering.
    Any stop-codon preferences specified in the file are ignored.
    The preferences file can be in several formats:

        * A comma-, tab-, or space-delimited file with the first column giving
          the site and the rest giving the preference for each amino-acid::

            site A C D E F G H I K L M N P Q R S T V W Y
            1 0.044  0.046 0.048 0.0461 0.046 0.0411 0.052 0.027 0.046 0.043 0.172 0.045 0.045 0.045 0.044 0.041 0.037 0.028 0.046 0.048
            2 0.658 0.006 0.005 0.029 0.005 0.019 0.007 0.004 0.007 0.001 0.036 0.005 0.009 0.003 0.005 0.014 0.013 0.148 0.009 0.005

        * The more complex `dms_tools`_ `preferences file format`_

    Importantly, the amino-acid preferences must be obtained **independently** from the sequence
    alignment being analyzed. A deep mutational scanning experiment is an independent means
    of obtaining the preferences, but estimating them from the amino-acid frequencies in the alignment of homologs is not a valid approach as you are then estimating the preferences from the same sequences that you are subsequently analyzing.

   outprefix
    If this prefix contains a directory name, that directory is created if it does not already exist. 

    See `Output files`_ for a description of the files created with this prefix. Any existing files with these names are deleted at the start of the program's execution.

   \-\-brlen
    The tree topology is fixed to that in ``tree``. 
    But there are several options for how the branch lengths are handled:

      * *scale*: fix the relative length of the branches to the values in ``tree``, but scale them all by a single parameter :math:`\mu` that is optimized. This approach will be faster.

      * *optimize*: optimize all branch lengths as free parameters. This approach will be more accurate, but slower.

   \-\-gammaomega
    Use this option for a `model` of *ExpCM* if you want :math:`\omega` to be drawn from ``--ncats`` gamma-distributed categories, similar to a *YNGKP_M5* model.
    This option adds one extra free parameter, as we are now optimizing two parameters for the :math:`\omega` distribution. It will also increase run-time by about 5-fold if you use the default for ``--ncats``.

    You do **not** use this option with *YNGKP* models; for those, simply set ``model`` to *YNGKP_M5* to get gamma-distributed :math:`\omega`.

   \-\-ncats
    Determines the number of categories when using ``--gammarates`` and `model` of *YNGKP_M5*. More categories leads to longer run-time, values of 4-5 are usually adequate.

   \-\-fitphi
    This option is not typically recommended. It will typically lead to only very slight improvements in log likelihood at substantial computational cost.

   \-\-omegabysite
    If using a YNGKP model, then the :math:`\omega_r` value is nearly analogous that obtained using the *FEL* model described by `Kosakovsky Pond and Frost, Mol Biol Evol, 22:1208-1222`_. If using and *ExpCM*, then :math:`\omega_r` has the meaning described in :ref:`ExpCM`. Essentially, we fix all other model / tree parameters and then compare a model that fits a synonymous and nonsynonymous rate to each site to a null model that only fits a synonymous rate; there is evidence for :math:`\omega_r \ne 1` if fitting both nonsynonymous and synonymous rate gives sufficiently better likelihood than fitting synonymous rate alone. See also the ``--omegabysite_fixsyn`` option.

   \-\-omegabysite_fixsyn
    This option is meaningful only if you are using ``--omegabysite``. If you use this option, then we compare a model in which we fit a nonsynonymous rate to each site to a model in which we fit nothing. The synonymous rate is not fit, and so is assumed to be equal to the overall value fit for the tree. According to `Kosakovsky Pond and Frost, Mol Biol Evol, 22:1208-1222`_, in some cases this can yield greater power if there is relatively limited data. However, it comes with the risk of giving spurious results if there is substantial variation in the synonymous substitution rate among sites.  

   \-\-divpressure
    Only for *ExpCM* models. This option specifies the name of the file with the predetermined diversifying pressure for each site, :math:`\delta_{r}`. ``phydms`` will fit :math:`\omega` and :math:`\omega_{2}` as described in :ref:`ExpCM`.

    You can **not** use ``--divpressure`` and ``--fitphi`` simultaneously.

   \-\-randprefs
    Only for *ExpCM* models. 
    This option randomly reassigns the preferences among sites. 
    This can be used as a control: randomizing the preferences should make them lose their efficacy for describing evolution.

   \-\-avgprefs
    Only for *ExpCM* models. 
    This option computes an average of each preference across sites (:math:`\pi_a = \frac{1}{L} \sum_r \pi_{r,a}` where :math:`r = 1, \ldots, L`), and then uses these average preferences for all sites. 
    This can be used as a control, as it merges all the information in the preferences into a non-site-specific model.

   \-\-minbrlen
    All branches with lengths less than this value will be set to this value in the initial starting tree. 
    Branches can still end up with lengths less than this after subsequent optimization of this starting tree.

   \-\-minpref
    Adjust all amino-acid preferences in the *ExpCM* ``prefsfile`` to be at least this large.
    If this number is too close to zero, you will get runtime errors.

   \-\-seed
    The random number seed affects the outcomes when there is randomization, as when using ``--randprefs``.


Output files
--------------
Running ``phydms`` will create the following output files, all with the prefix specified by ``outprefix``.

Log file
+++++++++++++
This is a text file with the suffix ``.log`` that records information about the program's progress.

Log likelihood file
++++++++++++++++++++++
This file has the suffix ``_loglikelihood.txt``. It simply gives the optimized log likelihood. Here is an example of a file's contents::
                
    log likelihood = -4415.24

Model parameters
++++++++++++++++++++
This file has the suffix ``_modelparams.txt``. 

Here is an example of the contents for an *ExpCM* model.
It gives the values of the parameters described in :ref:`ExpCM`; note that :math:`\mu` is **not** included as it is confounded with the branch lengths::

    beta = 2.99307
    kappa = 6.31364
    omega = 0.780782
    phiA = 0.372278
    phiC = 0.196416
    phiG = 0.224367

Here is an example of the contents for a *YNGKP_M0* model. 
In this file, `phi0A` is the corrected empirical frequency of `A` at the first codon site, `phi0A` is the frequency of `A` at the second codon site, etc.::

    kappa = 5.78484
    omega = 0.11308
    phi0A = 0.340656
    phi0C = 0.153395
    phi0G = 0.308294
    phi1A = 0.320503
    phi1C = 0.206698
    phi1G = 0.236844
    phi2A = 0.331485
    phi2C = 0.202991
    phi2G = 0.243997

If you use a model with a gamma-distributed :math:`\omega` (i.e., the ``--gammarates`` option for an *ExpCM*, or the *YNGKP_M5* model), then rather than having a single :math:`\omega` value, there are instead two parameters that determine the gamma distribution.
These are the shape parameter :math:`\alpha_{\omega}` (denoted *alpha_omega*) and the inverse scale parameter :math:`\beta_{\omega}` (denoted by *beta_omega*). 
The mean and variance of the omega distribution are :math:`\alpha_{\omega}/ \beta_{\omega}` and :math:`\alpha_{\omega} / \left(\beta_{\omega}\right)^2`, respectively.
To get the exact values, use the :ref:`api` to call ``phydmslib.models.DiscreteGamma(alpha_omega, beta_omega, ncats)`` where *ncats* is the value set by ``--ncats``. Here is an example of the model parameter file contents for an *ExpCM* with ``--gammaomega``::

    alpha_omega = 0.835183
    beta = 3.01549
    beta_omega = 0.976053
    kappa = 6.3424
    phiA = 0.372475
    phiC = 0.196471
    phiG = 0.22418


Tree file
++++++++++++
This file has the suffix ``_tree.newick``, and gives the optimized tree in Newick format. 
The branch lengths are in units of codon substitutions per site.

Site-specific omega file
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++
This file has the suffix ``_omegabysite.txt``, and is created only if using the ``--omegabysite`` option. This file gives the :math:`\omega_r` values optimized for each site. In the case of a *YNGKP* model, these are site-specific dN/dS ratios that should be essentially analogous to those obtained under the *FEL* model described by `Kosakovsky Pond and Frost, Mol Biol Evol, 22:1208-1222`_. In the case of an *ExpCM* model, these values indicate diversifying selection for nonsynonymous amino-acid change as described in :ref:`ExpCM`.

Here is an example of the first few lines of a file::

    # Omega fit to each site after fixing tree and and all other parameters.
    # Fits compared to null model of omega = 1.000; P-values NOT corrected for multiple testing.
    #
    # site  omega   P   dLnL
    472 99.000  0.00199 4.778
    284 0.001   0.00434 4.067
    319 0.001   0.00723 3.607
    20  99.000  0.00852 3.460
    373 99.000  0.00936 3.376
    350 0.001   0.0126  3.113
    465 99.000  0.0149  2.966
    470 99.000  0.0158  2.911
    289 0.001   0.016   2.899
    396 0.001   0.024   2.546
    129 0.001   0.0253  2.501
    84  0.001   0.0279  2.418
    247 0.001   0.029   2.383
    101 8.381   0.0325  2.287

The columns should be self-explanatory, the *P*-values are for rejection of the null hypothesis that :math:`\omega_r = 1` (calculated using a :math:`\chi_1^2` test; no correction for multiple testing is included, so you need to do that yourself if necessary for your question). The sites are sorted in the file by *P*-value.
